# DISCLAMER

Note: **THIS THEME IS NOT MINE** I have copied it to make changes when and if they need to happen.
This theme is updated often because Discords menues get updated and as result so do their classes
making the theme not apply to those elements. Usually I catch onto these missed emelemts and fix them as soon
as I encounter them, But if you find one that I missed then ping me on dicord by joining my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gBY5A9yZQX)

## Method 1

- Download the latest release of ``Nocturnal 3.0 Neo Fix``
- Hold ``Windows key + r`` and type ``%appdata%\betterdiscord\themes`` then press enter
- Move the file you downloaded into the folder that opened up
